# User Guide

This Guide will contain all valid cases of the parameters mentioned in the README.

The last two parameters about state space and action space will be explored differently for each case as they pertain to scalability which varies from algorithm to algorithm. 
About computational runtime, I will only consider examples that run in a reasonable amount of time on most machines. As the the scale increases, I will suggest faster algorithms with weaker guarantees.
